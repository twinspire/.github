**Note to users of Twinspire**

We are adding an "AI Clause" to all our licensing terms of people using Twinspire. For most users, this will not impact you. However, anyone using an AI service that can take source code from any source, known or otherwise, must be aware that any use of Twinspire code without declaring it is strictly prohibited. "Declaration" in this context means that you must:

 a) Be aware or in the knowledge that the source code you are using is copyrighted by any author and use is subject to applicable copyright law; and,
 b) Declare that your use of AI is for the generation of source code and that you acknowledge and confirm that the copyright of such source code belongs to their respective authors.

Our declaration is as follows:

**All our source code is hand-written and we do not use AI or AI-assisted technologies to generate, facilitate, or provide solutions to any one of our repositories, public or otherwise. The licences applied to the source code we write is therefore valid for the purposes of retaining copyright, and all users of such source code can use our code in the knowledge that none is generated from AI.**
